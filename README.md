Fifty Shades Freed

What does this app do?
----------------------

It displays 50 shades of grey, from 100% white to 0% white. What did you think it would do?

That sounds trivial. Is this a joke?
-------------------------------------

No. This app has been a test bed for me, to try out supporting new screen sizes or new platforms like ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜOS or tvOS. Most recently, I have updated it to all SwiftUI, which is a wonderful way to show how trivial apps can be build with minimal code in SwiftUI. Compare it to the old versions with lines and lines of boilerplate code. For all Apple Platforms, that is. Minimum deployment target is iOS 14, ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜOS 7.0, macOS 11 and tvOS 14, and you will need Xcode 12.

Catalyst App is left as an excercise to the reader

News: A command line app to create all the image assets has been included. This contains an example how to create a PNG file from  a SwiftUI [`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view). If you have a more elegant way, let me know.

But now, what about 50 Shades Of Grey?
--------------------------------------

Glad you came back to that topic! Let me take this opportunity to remind everyone that the Fifty Shades of Grey book series by E.L. James and film franchise cultivates and normalizes rape myths, psychological grooming for abuse, and sexual violence. Fifty Shades is not a risqué, passionate romance. It is not BDSM, either. It is a [story of sexual and domestic abuse](https://endsexualexploitation.org/fiftyshadesgrey/).
